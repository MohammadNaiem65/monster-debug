        <h1 class="text-4xl">1. Difference between <strong>Local Storage</strong> and <strong>Session Storage</strong>.
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-3">The <strong>localStorage</strong> read-only property of the window interface allows you to
            access a Storage object for the Document's origin the stored data is saved across browser sessions.
            localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while localStorage data has no expiration time,
            sessionStorage data gets cleared when the session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed. (localStorage
            data for a document loaded in a "private browsing" or "incognito" session is cleared when the last "private"
            tab is closed.)</p>

        <h1 class="w-4/5 mx-auto text-4xl">2. Difference between <strong>Global Scope</strong> and <strong>Block
                Scope</strong>.
        </h1>
        <p class="w-4/5 mx-auto mt-3">Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. An element
            in <strong>Global scope</strong> has access in every block of a webpage. ES6 introduced two important new
            JavaScript keywords: let and const. Both of this keywords are block scope variable. If they are declared in
            a block level object, this won't be available for global use or outside of the block. Mainly<strong> Block
                Scope</strong> means, all the things declared in a block</p>

        <h1 class="text-4xl">3. Describe <strong>Event loop</strong> in JavaScript.
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-3">JavaScript has a runtime model based on an <strong>Event</strong> loop, which is responsible for
            executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite
            different from models in other languages like C and Java.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">JavaScript executes it's codes in three parts. 1.<strong>Heap</strong>,
            2.<strong>Queue</strong>, 3.<strong>Event loop</strong>.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">Firstly, Objects are allocated in a heap which is just a name to denote a large (mostly
            unstructured) region of memory. Then, A JavaScript runtime uses a message queue, which is a list of messages
            to be processed. Each message has an associated function that gets called to handle the message. Now the
            "Event Loop's" comes in. queue.waitForMessage() waits synchronously for a message to arrive (if one is not
            already available and waiting to be handled).</p>
